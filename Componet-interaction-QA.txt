1) What options do we have to establish such communication? 
	-  @Input 
	-  @Output
	-  ViewChild
	-  Rxjs Subject
2) For each option describe what are the pros and cons of this solution?
	- Both Input and Output are one way data binding
	- if we pass data from parent to child then we should make sure that the data is updating to child whenever it changes using ngOnChanges
3) For each option describe what are the cases the solution fits best?
     -If we can pass data from parent to child then use @Input 
	 -If we can pass data from child to parent then use @Output
	 -If we want to access methods or elementRef of child component or directive from parent component then use @ViewChild
	 -If there there is no relationship between two components then use service(rxjs Subject)
